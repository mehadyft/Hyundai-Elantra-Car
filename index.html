            The midrange SEL model offers the best balance of price and
            features. Standard content over the SE includes a hands-free trunk
            release and SiriusXM. Additionally, opting for the SEL over the SE
            makes more worthwhile options available. For instance, we’d tick the
            box for the SEL Convenience package, which adds a 10.3-inch digital
            cluster in addition to a 10.3-inch center display for the
            infotainment system with built-in navigation; adaptive cruise
            control; a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob; a wireless
            smartphone charging pad; heated front seats; heated mirrors; and
            more.

        <h1>Engine, Transmission, and Performance</h1>
        <hr class="hr-2" />
        <p>
          The standard nonhybrid Elantra powertrain is a naturally aspirated
          2.0-liter four-cylinder engine that pushes out a not-very-exciting 147
          horsepower and 132 pound-feet of torque under the hood of SE and SEL
          models. Opting for the sportier N Line model drops displacement to 1.6
          liters and adds a turbocharger, resulting in a much livelier 201
          horsepower and 195 pound-feet of torque. The hybrid models also
          utilize a 1.6-liter four-pot but it’s paired with an electric motor
          rather than a turbo, which results in slightly less horsepower than
          the base engine at 139 but more torque at 195 pound-feet–equal to that
          of the N Line. The SE and SEL’s base 2.0-liter engine is mated to a
          CVT (continuously variable transmission) while the N Line, Blue
          Hybrid, and Limited Hybrid models get a DCT (dual-clutch
          transmission). Notably, the N Line gets a seven-speed DCT compared to
          the hybrids’ six-speed DCT. The hottest, enthusiast’s pick of the
          Elantra line by far is the performance-oriented N, which we review
          separately. But those who can't quite stomach that car's price tag
          could consider the tamer N Line model. After a brief test drive, we
          came away impressed with the N Line's perkier acceleration and its
          adept handling, which ups the athleticism without compromising the
          ride.

          An optional 10.3-inch digital gauge display rubs elbows with a second
          10.3-inch infotainment touchscreen that sprouts from the top of the
          Elantra's dashboard. The standard infotainment setup is an 8.0-inch
          center display and analog gauges for the instrument cluster. Hyundai's
          latest infotainment interface takes center stage here. Apple CarPlay
          and Android Auto are both standard, as is a Wi-Fi connection. A
          voice-recognition feature allows the driver to adjust things such as
          the climate control or the heated seats by simply uttering specific
          phrases. A six-speaker stereo is standard, but Limited and N-Line
          trims come with an eight-speaker Bose stereo instead.

                  The redesigned seventh generation stepped up the performance
                  game considerably. The only powertrains that carried over were
                  the201-hp 1.6L turbocharged ones (six-speed manual or
                  seven-speed dual-clutch auto), while the 147-hp 2.0L now came
                  with a CVT only and a 276-hp 2.0L turbocharged engine with
                  either the manual transmission or a new eight-speed
                  dual-clutch auto was added. There was now also a 139-hp 1.6L
                  hybrid with a six-speed automatic transmission.
